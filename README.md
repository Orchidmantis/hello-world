Hello world! 

I'm reporting to you from the cold and dreary land of Canada. As long as my fingers don't fall off due to frostbite I am looking to learn a thing or two from this site. I am new to coding and am welcome to any tips to help me get started. I'm a portrait artist, intensely creative and looking for a new challenge.
